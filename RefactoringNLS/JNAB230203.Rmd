title: "Refactoring `nls()`: a constructive critique"
date: "2023-02-03"
abstract: >
   Based on work for a Google Summer of Code project "Improvements to `nls()`",
   we consider the features and limitations of the R function `nls()`
   in the context of improving and rationalizing R tools for nonlinear regression.
   Important considerations are the usability and  maintainability of
   the code base that provides the functionality `nls()` claims to offer.
   Our work suggests that the
   existing code makes maintenance and improvement very difficult,
   with legacy applications and examples blocking some important updates.
   Discussion of these matters is relevant to improving R generally as
   well as its nonlinear estimation tools.
