Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Refactoring `nls()`: a constructive critique" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript reviews work carried out in a Google Summer of Code project in 2021 plus some follow-up work, particularly
with selfStart models. We itemize some concerns with nls(), pointing out some actual fixes and some potential ones. 

Because of the widespread use of nls() and its features, along with some important shortcomings in the underlying
algorithms, we believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful in guarding against possible 
errors in reported "solutions" as well as in the collective work to improve R and its resources.
