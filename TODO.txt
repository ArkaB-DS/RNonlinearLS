- nlsCompare: 
   - JN ideas about SAVE, probvec, methvec to be explored
   - probably a CRAN package with a vignette that is a blog post.
     The current vignette is more or less "documentation" of use
     of the existing package. You (I'll suggest nlsCompare be
     AB author and JN contributor) need to show how to extend with
     new problems and methods.
   - note that CRAN packages (should!) have citation files, and
     we should make sure it gets seen, especially as it evolves.
     JN plans to use it for a new nlsr version that allows some 
     testing of scaled and unscaled Marquardt, which if the tests
     show anything interesting, will highlight and reference the 
     work AB did. So we need to eventually get it publicized.
     If it is changing over time, may be simpler to leave on 
     Github rather than try for CRAN.
     
- MachineSummary 
   -- MachineSummary.Rmd is a decent basis for blog post
   -- refer to MachID.R several places i.e., JN has pointed to it for the
      StochOptim wrapper project in 2022 GSOC.
      
   -- Tests/TestsDoc -- AB blogpost? Perhaps keep on back burner. It could
      be a useful contribution for graduate coursework.
   
   -- DerivsNLS  -- blog post JN. Best done when nlsr is revised on CRAN.
   
- RefactoringNLS 
   This is probably close to trying with R Journal. 
   JN: I think one more review. There's always another typo!
   
- VarietyInNonlinearLeastSquaresCodes -- 
   intended for JSS, but I'm (JN) still not comfortable that it isn't just
   a "collection" if material with uneven level of detail. Plan to keep at
   it until September or so, then edit ruthlessly before submission. 
   AB: Are you willing to review? I'd prefer joint authorship to show your
   contributions. In fact, I suspect that the main contribution of the 
   project is the various documentation outputs, since nls() is just so
   awkward to work with.

- WorkingDocument4ImproveNLS -- internal JN will tidy and upload to repo 
   JN had better take a look. But this is mainly for us to recall what we
   did. However, a tidy will help future use.

COMPLETED OR CLOSED

- RNonlinearLS public repo has been set up
- PkgFromRbase -- blog -- JN with material from Duncan Murdoch, AB to edit, 
        Now on R-bloggers
